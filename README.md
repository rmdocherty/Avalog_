*Avalog* is a chess game where the pieces aren't fixed to the squares on the board - they can sit anywhere between. Set in a charming 8-bit Arthurian world, players can challenge their friends either on the couch or online. The concept is simple: instead of existing on a square, pieces now have a radius - if another piece overlaps onto that radius, the piece is taken. Pieces can move any distance up to and including the square they could move to in regular chess *i.e,* a pawn on its first move could move 0.1 squares, 1 square, 1.459 squares *etc*.

<h4>Key Features:</h4>

- **A new take on a classic:** learn which strategies work best in the new dimension!
- **Five playable factions:** each with their movement options and playstyles.
- **Draft mode:** pick your pieces from a random selection of the factions, then fight!
- **Customization:** choose from a selection of palettes and maps.
- **Lore!** Explore some of the Arthurian (and definitely not Arthurian) mythology.
