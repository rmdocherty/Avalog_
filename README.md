*Avalog* is a chess game where the pieces aren't fixed to the squares on the board - they can sit anywhere between. Set in a charming 8-bit Arthurian world, players can challenge their friends either on the couch or online.
Key Features:
- A new take on a classic: learn which strategies work best in the new dimension!
- Five playable factions, each with their movement options and playstyles.
- Draft mode: pick your pieces from a random selection of the factions, then fight!
- Customization: choose from a selection of palettes and maps.
- Lore! Explore some of the Arthurian (and definitely not Arthurian) mythology.
